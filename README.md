# YouTube-Category-Insights-2023

This analysis aims to find out how all of the YouTube video categories perform against each other. 

The data set I used was from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023).

The ‘images’ directory contains all the visualizations that have been used in the Jupyter Notebook.
