In the ever-evolving realm of online video content, YouTube stands as a global giant, providing a platform for creators to share their creativity with a vast and diverse audience. This notebook is dedicated to the analysis of YouTube in the year 2023, with a particular focus on unraveling the mysteries of genre/category popularity.

As we journey through the data, we aim to discover which video genres have garnered the most attention and engagement from viewers in the past year. Through data-driven exploration and visualization, we will highlight the genres that have thrived and explore the factors contributing to their success.

Whether you're a content creator seeking inspiration or a data enthusiast intrigued by the YouTube landscape, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the content genres that have resonated with audiences in 2023.

Note: There is a lot more that can be found using the dataset which I have used. But my analysis is based on small questions as of now, to keep things simple. 

The dataset that is used has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023), and is not my own. All credits for the collections and compilation of this dataset goes to the respective kaggle user.
